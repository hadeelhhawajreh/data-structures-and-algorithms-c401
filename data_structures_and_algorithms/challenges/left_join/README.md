# Hashmap LEFT JOIN
Write a function that LEFT JOINs two hashmaps into a single data structure.
The first parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and a synonym of the key as values.
The second parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and antonyms of the key as values.


## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Combine the key and corresponding values (if they exist) into a new data structure according to LEFT JOIN logic.
