# Linked list I
+ linked list is a type of to add and orgnize data  containes node 
+ each node has a value and next 


## Challenge
how to test using fixture but doesn't work ;(
and how to check the include value in ll 

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
+ Insert  function 
    time o(1)
    space o(1)

+ Include function 
    time o(n)
    space o(1)



## Solution

# Linked list II 
+ append(value) which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list

+ insertBefore(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node

+ insertAfter(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node
