# PseudoQueue
This PseudoQueue class will implement our standard queue interface (the two methods listed below), but will internally only utilize 2 Stack objects. Ensure that you create your class with the following methods:

stackEnqueue(value) which inserts value into the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
stackDequeue() which extracts a value from the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
The Stack instances have only push, pop, and peek methods.using Stack implementation. Instantiate these Stack objects in your PseudoQueue constructor.

## Challenge
find the easiest way and that was using the list.

## Approach & Efficiency
stackEnqueue()
Space ->o(n)  
time ->o(1)

stackDequeue()
Space ->o(n)  
time ->o(1)
